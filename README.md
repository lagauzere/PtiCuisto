## Lessons Learned :

### - Building a Project Without a Framework in MVC architecture :
- Code Organization: Organizing code in a clear and maintainable manner is crucial. With MVC, understanding the separation of concerns (Models, Views, Controllers) helps in creating a scalable and maintainable codebase.

- Understanding Dependencies: Without a framework managing dependencies, understanding how components rely on each other becomes essential. Manual dependency management can be challenging but provides a deeper understanding of the system.

### - Challenges Faced and Overcoming Them :

- Lack of Structure: Creating a well-organized file structure and adhering to it helps manage the codebase effectively.

- Reusability and DRY Principles: Achieving code reusability without the assistance of a framework can be challenging. Creating helper functions or utility classes can help maintain the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle.

- Security Concerns: In a custom setup, ensuring secure coding practices, such as input validation and sanitization, becomes the responsibility of the developer.

### - Building a Database from Scratch:

- Database Design: Designing an efficient database schema is crucial. Understanding relationships, normalization, and indexing is vital for optimal performance.

- SQL Knowledge: A deep understanding of SQL is required. Creating tables, defining relationships, and crafting complex queries are fundamental skills.

- Data Integrity: Ensuring data integrity through constraints (primary keys, foreign keys) is critical. Handling transactions and preventing data anomalies becomes a key focus.
